## *Description* 
Creation of a High quality README.md from user's input and the inquirer package.
This professional README Generator had to have the following features:
Via a command-line application that accepts user input, a professional README will be generated based on responses given to questions asked by the program.


The user has to enter a description of the project, the steps required to run their project, what the project is used for, a screenshot url.  They also have to select a licence (which has a default of MIT).  A badge is provided for the default.  They also have an opportunity to add their own url badges.

Github, Linkedin and email addresses can also be entered so that the user is contactable for any questions regarding the project.

When all responses are completed (filled or not, defaults selected or not), the README.MD is generated in the same directory as the file is run.
- 
## *Installation*
To run, node.js must be installed. The file index.js must be downloaded to a directory. Open the command line (within the same directory as index.js).  
Then type node index.js to run.  The questions will then be generated with prompts for the user to respond. CTRL-C can terminate the program at any point.



## *Usage* 
To generate an online README.
## *Credits*
- [Inquirer commands] (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-interactive-command-line-prompts#basic-usage )
- [License badges](https://shields.io/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)


## *Technologies Used*
The code was written using JavaScript in a node environment using an npm called 'Inquirer' (see credits above).  The video was recorded using Screencastify - a free application used via the Chrome browser.
